                                Each `ref` child will be interpreted in order of
                                appearance. Any overlapping definitions will replace
                                preceding instances, with each subsequent `ref`
                                replacing any duplicate node components.

                                The replacement rules are as follows, and apply recursively:
                                * node properties MUST by replaced by key.
                                * node arguments MUST be replaced by order of appearance.
                                * `prop` definitions MUST be replaced by key (their first argument)
                                * `arg` definitions MUST be replaced based on _order of
                                   appearance_. That is, the first `arg` in ref `B` till be
                                   merged into the first `arg` in preceding ref `A`.
                                * For all other components:
                                    * If the definition specified is marked as
                                      `repeatable`, then all definitions using that node
                                      will be concatenated, with later `ref`s
                                      concatenating definitions after the previous `ref`'s
                                      definitions.
                                    * If the definition is NOT marked as `repeatable`,
                                      it will be replaced by subsequent `ref`s.

                                Once all `ref` children are resolved, the containing
                                node's own items will override anything defined by
                                `ref`s, using the same rules as above (essentially, the
                                current node is treated as a 'final `ref`').

                                If both an ID argument and a `path` are provided,
                                the ID will take precedence and, if not found, fall
                                back to the path. For `id` and `path` children,
                                precedence is in order of appearance, regardless of
                                whether the child is an `id` or a `path`.

                                If no items resolve into a valid ref, validation
                                MUST error, unless the ref is configured as
                                `optional`, in which case validation MAY warn, but
                                MUST NOT fail.

                                        default.

                                        `optional` only applies to *presence*:
                                        an existing argument in an optional
                                        `arg` \"slot\" that fails validation
                                        will fail normally, even though it is
                                        optional. As such, `optional` is only
                                        really useful if it is on the last
                                        `arg`, or is only followed by optional
                                        `arg`s.

            By convention, the format of this value is intended to be similar to
            git's commit message system: The first line is treated as a short
            descriptor/summary, and any lines underneath it are treated as the
            longer-form documentation. As such, the first line SHOULD be up to
            50 characters in length.
            
            Tooling SHOULD only display some or all of the first line in user
            interfaces that call for terseness, and they SHOULD display both the
            short descriptor and the longer explanation.

                precedence.
