# KDL Spec

This is the formal specification for KDL, including the intended data model and
the grammar.

This document describes KDL version `2.0.0`. It was released on 2024-12-16. It
is the latest stable version of the language, and will only be edited for minor
copyedits or major errata.

## Compatibility

KDL 2.0 is designed such that for any given KDL document written as [KDL
1.0](./SPEC_v1.md) or KDL 2.0, the parse will either fail completely, or, if the
parse succeeds, the data represented by a v1 or v2 parser will be identical.
This means that it's safe to use a fallback parsing strategy in order to support
both v1 and v2 simultaneously. For example, `node "foo"` is a valid node in both
versions, and should be represented identically by parsers.

## Introduction

KDL is a node-oriented document language. Its niche and purpose overlaps with
XML, and as do many of its semantics. You can use KDL both as a configuration
language, and a data exchange or storage format, if you so choose.

The bulk of this document is dedicated to a long-form description of all
[Components](#components) of a KDL document. There is also a much more terse
[Grammar](#full-grammar) at the end of the document that covers most of the
rules, with some semantic exceptions involving the data model.

KDL is designed to be easy to read _and_ easy to implement.

In this document, references to "left" or "right" refer to directions in the
*data stream* towards the beginning or end, respectively; in other words,
the directions if the data stream were only ASCII text. They do not refer
to the writing direction of text, which can flow in either direction,
depending on the characters used.

## Components

### Document

The toplevel concept of KDL is a Document. A Document is composed of zero or
more [Nodes](#node), separated by newlines and whitespace, and eventually
terminated by an EOF.

All KDL documents should be UTF-8 encoded and conform to the specifications in
this document.

#### Example

The following is a document composed of two toplevel nodes:

```kdl
foo {
    bar
}
baz
```

### Node

Being a node-oriented language means that the real core component of any KDL
document is the "node". Every node must have a name, which must be a
[String](#string).

The name may be preceded by a [Type Annotation](#type-annotation) to further
clarify its type, particularly in relation to its parent node. (For example,
clarifying that a particular `date` child node is for the _publication_ date,
rather than the last-modified date, with `(published)date`.)

Following the name are zero or more [Arguments](#argument) or
[Properties](#property), separated by either [whitespace](#whitespace) or [a
slash-escaped line continuation](#line-continuation). Arguments and Properties
may be interspersed in any order, much like is common with positional arguments
vs options in command line tools. Collectively, Arguments and Properties may be
referred to as "Entries".

[Children](#children-block) can be placed after the name and the optional
Entries, possibly separated by either whitespace or a
slash-escaped line continuation.

Arguments are ordered relative to each other and that order must be preserved in
order to maintain the semantics. Properties between Arguments do not affect
Argument ordering.

By contrast, Properties _SHOULD NOT_ be assumed to be presented in a given
order. [Children](#children-block) should be used if an order-sensitive
key/value data structure must be represented in KDL. Cf. JSON objects
preserving key order.

Nodes _MAY_ be prefixed with [Slashdash](#slashdash-comments) to "comment out"
the entire node, including its properties, arguments, and children, and make
it act as plain whitespace, even if it spreads across multiple lines.

Finally, a node is terminated by either a [Newline](#newline), a semicolon
(`;`), the end of a child block (`}`) or the end of the file/stream (an `EOF`).

#### Example

```kdl
// `foo` will have an Argument value list like `[1, 3]`.
foo 1 key=val 3 {
    bar
    (role)baz 1 2
}
```

### Line Continuation

Line continuations allow [Nodes](#node) to be spread across multiple lines.

A line continuation is a `\` character followed by zero or more whitespace
items (including multiline comments) and an optional single-line comment. It
must be terminated by a [Newline](#newline) (including the Newline that is
part of single-line comments).

Following a line continuation, processing of a Node can continue as usual.

#### Example

```kdl
my-node 1 2 \  // comments are ok after \
        3 4    // This is the actual end of the Node.
```

### Property

A Property is a key/value pair attached to a [Node](#node). A Property is
composed of a [String](#string), followed immediately by an equals sign (`=`, `U+003D`),
and then a [Value](#value).

Properties should be interpreted left-to-right, with rightmost properties with
identical names overriding earlier properties. That is:

```kdl
node a=1 a=2
```

In this example, the node's `a` value must be `2`, not `1`.

No other guarantees about order should be expected by implementers.
Deserialized representations may iterate over properties in any order and
still be spec-compliant.

Properties _MAY_ be prefixed with `/-` to "comment out" the entire token and
make it act as plain whitespace, even if it spreads across multiple lines.

### Argument

An Argument is a bare [Value](#value) attached to a [Node](#node), with no
associated key. It shares the same space as [Properties](#properties), and may be interleaved with them.

A Node may have any number of Arguments, which should be evaluated left to
right. KDL implementations _MUST_ preserve the order of Arguments relative to
each other (not counting Properties).

Arguments _MAY_ be prefixed with `/-` to "comment out" the entire token and
make it act as plain whitespace, even if it spreads across multiple lines.

#### Example

```kdl
my-node 1 2 3 a b c
```

### Children Block

A children block is a block of [Nodes](#node), surrounded by `{` and `}`. They
are an optional part of nodes, and create a hierarchy of KDL nodes.

Regular node termination rules apply, which means multiple nodes can be
included in a single-line children block, as long as they're all terminated by
`;`.

#### Example

```kdl
parent {
    child1
    child2
}

parent { child1; child2; }
```

### Value

A value is either: a [String](#string), a [Number](#number), a
[Boolean](#boolean), or [Null](#null).

Values _MUST_ be either [Arguments](#argument) or values of
[Properties](#property). Only [String](#string) values may be used as
[Node](#node) names or [Property](#property) keys.

Values (both as arguments and in properties) _MAY_ be prefixed by a single
[Type Annotation](#type-annotation).

### Type Annotation

A type annotation is a prefix to any [Node Name](#node) or [Value](#value) that
includes a _suggestion_ of what type the value is _intended_ to be treated as,
or as a _context-specific elaboration_ of the more generic type the node name
indicates.

Type annotations are written as a set of `(` and `)` with a single
[String](#string) in it. It may contain Whitespace after the `(` and before
the `)`, and may be separated from its target by Whitespace.

KDL does not specify any restrictions on what implementations might do with
these annotations. They are free to ignore them, or use them to make decisions
about how to interpret a value.

Additionally, the following type annotations MAY be recognized by KDL parsers
and, if used, SHOULD interpret these types as follows:

#### Reserved Type Annotations for Numbers Without Decimals:

Signed integers of various sizes (the number is the bit size):

* `i8`
* `i16`
* `i32`
* `i64`
* `i128`

Unsigned integers of various sizes (the number is the bit size):

* `u8`
* `u16`
* `u32`
* `u64`
* `u128`

Platform-dependent integer types, both signed and unsigned:

* `isize`
* `usize`

#### Reserved Type Annotations for Numbers With Decimals:

IEEE 754 floating point numbers, both single (32) and double (64) precision:

* `f32`
* `f64`

#### Examples

```kdl
node (u8)123
node prop=(regex).*
(published)date "1970-01-01"
(contributor)person name="Foo McBar"
```

### String

Strings in KDL represent textual UTF-8 [Values](#value). A String is either an
[Identifier String](#identifier-string) (like `foo`), a
[Quoted String](#quoted-string) (like `"foo"`)
or a [Multi-Line String](#multi-line-string).
Both Quoted and Multiline strings come in normal
and [Raw String](#raw-string) variants (like `#"foo"#`):

* Identifier Strings let you write short, "single-word" strings with a
  minimum of syntax
* Quoted Strings let you write strings "like normal", with whitespace and escapes.
* Multi-Line Strings let you write strings across multiple lines
    and with indentation that's not part of the string value.
* Raw Strings don't allow any escapes,
  allowing you to not worry about the string's content containing anything that
  might look like an escape.

Strings _MUST_ be represented as UTF-8 values.

Strings _MUST NOT_ include the code points for
[disallowed literal code points](#disallowed-literal-code-points) directly.
Quoted and Multi-Line Strings may include these code points as _values_
by representing them with their corresponding `\u{...}` escape.

### Identifier String

An Identifier String (sometimes referred to as just an "identifier") is
composed of any [Unicode Scalar
Value](https://unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value) other than
[non-initial characters](#non-initial-characters), followed by any number of
Unicode Scalar Values other than [non-identifier
characters](#non-identifier-characters).

A handful of patterns are disallowed, to avoid confusion with other values:

* idents that appear to start with a [Number](#number) (like `1.0v2` or
    `-1em`) or the "almost a number" pattern of a decimal point without a
    leading digit (like `.1`).
* idents that are the language keywords (`inf`, `-inf`, `nan`, `true`,
  `false`, and `null`) without their leading `#`.

Identifiers that match these patterns _MUST_ be treated as a syntax error; such
values can only be written as quoted or raw strings. The precise details of the
identifier syntax is specified in the [Full Grammar](#full-grammar) below.

Identifier Strings are terminated by [Whitespace](#whitespace) or
[Newlines](#newline).

#### Non-initial characters

The following characters cannot be the first character in an
[Identifier String](#identifier-string):

* Any decimal digit (0-9)
* Any [non-identifier characters](#non-identifier-characters)

Additionally, the `-` character can only be used as an initial character if
the second character is *not* a digit. This allows identifiers to look like
`--this`, and removes the ambiguity of having an identifier look like a
negative number.

#### Non-identifier characters

The following characters cannot be used anywhere in a [Identifier String](#identifier-string):

* Any of `(){}[]/\"#;=`
* Any [Whitespace](#whitespace) or [Newline](#newline).
* Any [disallowed literal code points](#disallowed-literal-code-points) in KDL
  documents.

### Quoted String

A Quoted String is delimited by `"` on either side of any number of literal
string characters except unescaped `"` and `\`.

Literal [Newline](#newline) characters can only be included
if they are [Escaped Whitespace](#escaped-whitespace),
which discards them from the string value.
Actually including a newline in the value requires using a newline escape sequence,
like `\n`,
or using a [Multi-Line String](#multi-line-string)
which is actually designed for strings stretching across multiple lines.

Like Identifier Strings, Quoted Strings _MUST NOT_ include any of the
[disallowed literal code-points](#disallowed-literal-code-points) as code
points in their body.

Quoted Strings have a [Raw String](#raw-string) variant,
which disallows escapes.

#### Escapes

In addition to literal code points, a number of "escapes" are supported in Quoted Strings.
"Escapes" are the character `\` followed by another character, and are
interpreted as described in the following table:

| Name                          | Escape | Code Pt  |
|-------------------------------|--------|----------|
| Line Feed                     | `\n`   | `U+000A` |
| Carriage Return               | `\r`   | `U+000D` |
| Character Tabulation (Tab)    | `\t`   | `U+0009` |
| Reverse Solidus (Backslash)   | `\\`   | `U+005C` |
| Quotation Mark (Double Quote) | `\"`   | `U+0022` |
| Backspace                     | `\b`   | `U+0008` |
| Form Feed                     | `\f`   | `U+000C` |
| Space                         | `\s`   | `U+0020` |
| Unicode Escape                | `\u{(1-6 hex chars)}` | Code point described by hex characters, as long as it represents a [Unicode Scalar Value](https://unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value) |
| Whitespace Escape             | See below | N/A   |

##### Escaped Whitespace

In addition to escaping individual characters, `\` can also escape whitespace.
When a `\` is followed by one or more literal whitespace characters, the `\`
and all of that whitespace are discarded. For example, `"Hello World"` and
`"Hello \    World"` are semantically identical. See [whitespace](#whitespace)
and [newlines](#newline) for how whitespace is defined.

Note that only literal whitespace is escaped; whitespace escapes (`\n` and
such) are retained. For example, these strings are all semantically identical:

```kdl
"Hello\       \nWorld"

    "Hello\n\
    World"

"Hello\nWorld"

"""
  Hello
  World
  """
```

##### Invalid escapes

Except as described in the escapes table, above, `\` *MUST NOT* precede any
other characters in a string.

### Multi-line String

Multi-Line Strings support multiple lines with literal, non-escaped
Newlines. They must use a special multi-line syntax, and they automatically
"dedent" the string, allowing its value to be indented to a visually matching
level as desired.

A Multi-Line String is opened and closed by *three* double-quote characters,
like `"""`.
Its first line _MUST_ immediately start with a [Newline](#newline)
after its opening `"""`.
Its final line _MUST_ contain only whitespace
before the closing `"""`.
All in-between lines that contain non-newline, non-whitespace characters
_MUST_ start with _at least_ the exact same whitespace as the final line
(precisely matching codepoints, not merely counting characters or "size");
they may contain additional whitespace following this prefix. The lines in
between may contain unescaped `"` (but no unescaped `"""` as this would close
the string).

The value of the Multi-Line String omits the first and last Newline, the
Whitespace of the last line, and the matching Whitespace prefix on all
intermediate lines. The first and last Newline can be the same character (that
is, empty multi-line strings are legal).

In other words, the final line specifies the whitespace prefix that will be
removed from all other lines.

Multi-line Strings that do not immediately start with a Newline and whose final
`"""` is not preceeded by optional whitespace and a Newline are illegal. This
also means that `"""` may not be used for a single-line String (e.g.
`"""foo"""`).

#### Newline Normalization

Literal Newline sequences in Multi-line Strings must be normalized to a single
`U+000A` (`LF`) during deserialization. This means, for example, that `CR LF`
becomes a single `LF` during parsing.

This normalization does not apply to non-literal Newlines entered using escape
sequences. That is:

```kdl
multi-line """
    \r\n[CRLF]
    foo[CRLF]
    """
```

becomes:

```kdl
single-line "\r\n\nfoo"
```

For clarity: this normalization applies to each individual Newline sequence.
That is, the literal sequence `CRLF CRLF` becomes `LF LF`, not `LF`.

#### Example

```kdl
multi-line """
        foo
    This is the base indentation
            bar
    """
```

This example's string value will be:

```
    foo
This is the base indentation
        bar
```

which is equivalent to `"    foo\nThis is the base indentation\n        bar"`
when written as a single-line string.

---------

If the last line wasn't indented as far,
it won't dedent the rest of the lines as much:

```kdl
multi-line """
        foo
    This is no longer on the left edge
            bar
  """
```

This example's string value will be:

```
      foo
  This is no longer on the left edge
          bar
```

Equivalent to `"      foo\n  This is no longer on the left edge\n          bar"`.

-----------

Empty lines can contain any whitespace, or none at all, and will be reflected as empty in the value:

```kdl
multi-line """
    Indented a bit

    A second indented paragraph.
    """
```

This example's string value will be:

```
Indented a bit.

A second indented paragraph.
```

Equivalent to `"Indented a bit.\n\nA second indented paragraph."`

-----------

The following yield **syntax errors**:

```kdl
multi-line """can't be single line"""
```

```kdl
multi-line """
  closing quote with non-whitespace prefix"""
```

```kdl
multi-line """stuff
  """
```

```kdl
// Every line must share the exact same prefix as the closing line.
multi-line """[\n]
[tab]a[\n]
[space][space]b[\n]
[space][tab][\n]
[tab]"""
```

#### Interaction with Whitespace Escapes

Multi-line strings support the same mechanism for escaping whitespace as Quoted
Strings.

When processing a Multi-line String, implementations MUST dedent the string
_after_ resolving all whitespace escapes, but _before_ resolving other backslash
escapes. This means a whitespace escape that attempts to escape the final line's
newline and/or whitespace prefix can be invalid: if removing escaped whitespace
places the closing `"""` on a line with non-whitespace characters, this escape
is invalid.

For example, the following example is illegal:

```kdl
  """
  foo
  bar\
  """

  // equivalent to
  """
  foo
  bar"""
```

while the following example is allowed
```kdl
  """
  foo \
bar
  baz
  \   """
  
  // equivalent to
  """
  foo bar
  baz
  """
```

### Raw String

Both [Quoted](#quoted-string) and [Multi-Line Strings](#multi-line-string) have
Raw String variants, which are identical in syntax except they do not support
`\`-escapes. This includes line-continuation escapes (`\` + `ws` collapsing to
nothing). They otherwise share the same properties as far as literal
[Newline](#newline) characters go, multi-line rules, and the requirement of
UTF-8 representation.

The Raw String variants are indicated by preceding the strings's opening quotes
with one or more `#` characters. The string is then closed by its normal closing
quotes, followed by a _matching_ number of `#` characters. This means that the
string may contain any combination of `"` and `#` characters other than its
closing delimiter (e.g., if a raw string starts with `##"`, it can contain `"`
or `"#`, but not `"##` or `"###`).

Like other Strings, Raw Strings _MUST NOT_ include any of the [disallowed
literal code-points](#disallowed-literal-code-points) as code points in their
body. Unlike with Quoted Strings, these cannot simply be escaped, and are thus
unrepresentable when using Raw Strings.

#### Example

```kdl
just-escapes #"\n will be literal"#
```

The string contains the literal characters `\n will be literal`.

```kdl
quotes-and-escapes ##"hello\n\r\asd"#world"##
```

The string contains the literal characters `hello\n\r\asd"#world`

```kdl
raw-multi-line #"""
    You can show examples of """
        multi-line strings
        """
    without worrying about escapes.
    """#
```

The string contains the value

```
You can show examples of """
    multi-line strings
    """
without worrying about escapes.
```

or equivalently, `"You can show examples of \"\"\"\n    multi-line strings\n    \"\"\"\nwithout worrying about escapes."` as a Quoted String.

### Number

Numbers in KDL represent numerical [Values](#value). There is no logical distinction in KDL
between real numbers, integers, and floating point numbers. It's up to
individual implementations to determine how to represent KDL numbers.

There are five syntaxes for Numbers: Keywords, Decimal, Hexadecimal, Octal, and Binary.

* All non-[Keyword](#keyword-numbers) numbers may optionally start with one of `-` or `+`, which determine whether they'll be positive or negative.
* Binary numbers start with `0b` and only allow `0` and `1` as digits, which may be separated by `_`. They represent numbers in radix 2.
* Octal numbers start with `0o` and only allow digits between `0` and `7`, which may be separated by `_`. They represent numbers in radix 8.
* Hexadecimal numbers start with `0x` and allow digits between `0` and `9`, as well as letters `A` through `F`, in either lower or upper case, which may be separated by `_`. They represent numbers in radix 16.
* Decimal numbers are a bit more special:
    * They have no radix prefix.
    * They use digits `0` through `9`, which may be separated by `_`.
    * They may optionally include a decimal separator `.`, followed by more digits, which may again be separated by `_`.
    * They may optionally be followed by `E` or `e`, an optional `-` or `+`, and more digits, to represent an exponent value.

Note that, similar to JSON and some other languages,
numbers without an integer digit (such as `.1`) are illegal.
They must be written with at least one integer digit, like `0.1`.
(These patterns are also disallowed from [Identifier Strings](#identifier-string), to avoid confusion.)

#### Keyword Numbers

There are three special "keyword" numbers included in KDL to accomodate the
widespread use of [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floats:

* `#inf` - floating point positive infinity.
* `#-inf` - floating point negative infinity.
* `#nan` - floating point NaN/Not a Number.

To go along with this and prevent foot guns, the bare [Identifier
Strings](#identifier-string) `inf`, `-inf`, and `nan` are considered illegal
identifiers and should yield a syntax error.

The existence of these keywords does not imply that any numbers be represented
as IEEE 754 floats. These are simply for clarity and convenience for any
implementation that chooses to represent their numbers in this way.

### Boolean

A boolean [Value](#value) is either the symbol `#true` or `#false`. These
_SHOULD_ be represented by implementation as boolean logical values, or some
approximation thereof.

#### Example

```kdl
my-node #true value=#false
```

### Null

The symbol `#null` represents a null [Value](#value). It's up to the
implementation to decide how to represent this, but it generally signals the
"absence" of a value.

#### Example

```kdl
my-node #null key=#null
```

### Whitespace

The following characters should be treated as non-[Newline](#newline) [white
space](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropList.txt):

| Name                 | Code Pt |
|----------------------|---------|
| Character Tabulation | `U+0009`  |
| Line Tabulation      | `U+000B`  |
| Space                | `U+0020`  |
| No-Break Space       | `U+00A0`  |
| Ogham Space Mark     | `U+1680`  |
| En Quad              | `U+2000`  |
| Em Quad              | `U+2001`  |
| En Space             | `U+2002`  |
| Em Space             | `U+2003`  |
| Three-Per-Em Space   | `U+2004`  |
| Four-Per-Em Space    | `U+2005`  |
| Six-Per-Em Space     | `U+2006`  |
| Figure Space         | `U+2007`  |
| Punctuation Space    | `U+2008`  |
| Thin Space           | `U+2009`  |
| Hair Space           | `U+200A`  |
| Narrow No-Break Space| `U+202F`  |
| Medium Mathematical Space | `U+205F`  |
| Ideographic Space    | `U+3000`  |

#### Single-line comments

Any text after `//`, until the next literal [Newline](#newline) is "commented
out", and is considered to be [Whitespace](#whitespace).

#### Multi-line comments

In addition to single-line comments using `//`, comments can also be started
with `/*` and ended with `*/`. These comments can span multiple lines. They
are allowed in all positions where [Whitespace](#whitespace) is allowed and
can be nested.

#### Slashdash comments

Finally, a special kind of comment called a "slashdash", denoted by `/-`, can
be used to comment out entire _components_ of a KDL document logically, and
have those elements not be included as part of the parsed document data.

Slashdash comments can be used before the following, including before their type
annotations, if present:

* A [Node](#node): the entire Node is treated as Whitespace, including all
  props, args, and children.
* An [Argument](#argument): the Argument value is treated as Whitespace.
* A [Property](#property) key: the entire property, including both key and value,
  is treated as Whitespace. A slashdash of just the property value is not allowed.
* A [Children Block](#children-block): the entire block, including all
  children within, is treated as Whitespace. Only other children blocks, whether
  slashdashed or not, may follow a slashdashed children block.
  
A slashdash may be be followed by any amount of whitespace, including newlines and
comments (other than other slashdashes), before the element that it comments out.

### Newline

The following character sequences [should be treated as new
lines](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch05.pdf):

| Acronym | Name            | Code Pt |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| CRLF    | Carriage Return and Line Feed | `U+000D` + `U+000A` |
| CR      | Carriage Return | `U+000D`  |
| LF      | Line Feed       | `U+000A`  |
| NEL     | Next Line       | `U+0085`  |
| FF      | Form Feed       | `U+000C`  |
| LS      | Line Separator  | `U+2028`  |
| PS      | Paragraph Separator | `U+2029` |

Note that for the purpose of new lines, the specific sequence `CRLF` is
considered _a single newline_.

### Disallowed Literal Code Points

The following code points may not appear literally anywhere in the document.
They may be represented in Strings (but not Raw Strings) using [Unicode Escapes](#escapes) (`\u{...}`).

* The codepoints `U+0000-0008` or the codepoints `U+000E-001F`  (various
  control characters).
* `U+007F` (the Delete control character).
* Any codepoint that is not a [Unicode Scalar
  Value](https://unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value) (`U+D800-DFFF`).
* `U+200E-200F`, `U+202A-202E`, and `U+2066-2069`, the [unicode
  "direction control"
  characters](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-unicode-controls)
* `U+FEFF`, aka Zero-width Non-breaking Space (ZWNBSP)/Byte Order Mark (BOM),
  except as the first code point in a document.

### Version marker

A version marker `/- kdl-version 2` (or `1`) _MAY_  be added to the beginning of a KDL document, optionally preceded by the BOM, and parsers _MAY_ use that as a hint as to which version to parse the document as.

### Grammar language

The grammar language syntax is a combination of ABNF with some regex spice thrown in.
Specifically:

* Single quotes (`'`) are used to denote literal text. `\` within a literal
  string is used for escaping other single-quotes, for initiating unicode
  characters using hex values (`\u{FEFF}`), and for escaping `\` itself
  (`\\`).
* `*` is used for "zero or more", `+` is used for "one or more", and `?` is
  used for "zero or one". Per standard regex semantics, `*` and `+` are *greedy*;
  they match as many instances as possible without failing the match.
* `*?` (used only in raw strings) indicates a *non-greedy* match;
  it matches as *few* instances as possible without failing the match.
* `¶` is a *cut point*. It always matches and consumes no characters,
  but once matched, the parser is not allowed to backtrack past that point in the source.
  If a parser would rewind past the cut point, it must instead fail the overall parse,
  as if it had run out of options.
  (This is only used with the `raw-string` production,
  to ensure the first instance of the appropriate closing quote sequence
  is guaranteed to be the end of the raw string,
  rather than allowing it to potentially consume more of the document unexpectedly.)
* `()` can be used to group matches that must be matched together.
* `a | b` means `a or b`, whichever matches first. If multiple items are before
  a `|`, they are a single group. `a b c | d` is equivalent to `(a b c) | d`.
* `[]` are used for regex-style character matches, where any character between
  the brackets will be a single match. `\` is used to escape `\`, `[`, and
  `]`. They also support character ranges (`0-9`), and negation (`^`)
* `-` is used for "except for" or "minus" whatever follows it. For example,
  `a - 'x'` means "any `a`, except something that matches the literal `'x'`".
* The prefix `^` means "something that does not match" whatever follows it.
  For example, `^foo` means "must not match `foo`".
* A single definition may be split over multiple lines. Newlines are treated as
  spaces.
* `//` followed by text on its own line is used as comment syntax.
