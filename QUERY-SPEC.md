# KDL Query Language Spec

The KDL Query Language is a small language specially tailored for querying KDL
documents to extract nodes and even specific data. It is loosely based on CSS
selectors for familiarity and ease of use. Think of it as CSS Selectors or
XPath, but for KDL!

## Selectors

Selectors use selection operators to filter nodes that will be returned by an
API using KQL. The main differences between this and CSS selectors are the
lack of `*` (use `[]` instead), and the specific syntax for
[matchers](#matchers) (the stuff between `[` and `]`), which is similar, but not identical to CSS.

* `a > b`: Selects any `b` element that is a direct child of an `a` element.
* `a b`: Selects any `b` element that is a _descendant_ of an `a` element.
* `a b || a c`: Selects all `b` and `c` elements that are descendants of an `a` element. Any selector may be on either side of the `||`. Multiple `||` are supported.
* `a + b`: Selects any `b` element that is placed immediately after a sibling `a` element.
* `a ~ b`: Selects any `b` element that follows an `a` element as a sibling, either immediately or later.
* `[accessor()]`: Selects any element, filtered by [an accessor](#accessors). (`accessor()` is a placeholder, not an actual accessor)
* `a[accessor()]`: Selects any `a` element, filtered by an accessor.
* `[]`: Selects any element (a )

## Matchers

Matchers are used to filter nodes by their various attributes (such as values,
properties, node names, etc). With the exception of `top()` and `()`, they are all
used inside a `[ ]` selector. Some matchers are unary, but most of them involve
binary operators.

* `top()`: Returns all toplevel children of the current document.
* `top() > []`: Equivalent to `top()` on its own.
* `(foo)`: Selects any element with a tag named `foo`.
* `()`: Selects any element with any tag.
* `[val()]`: Selects any element with a value.
* `[val(1)]`: Selects any element with a second value.
* `[prop(foo)]`: Selects any element with a property named `foo`.
* `[prop]`: Selects any element with a property named `prop`.

Attribute matchers support certain binary operators:

* `[val() = 1]`: Selects any element whose first value is 1.
* `[prop(name) = 1]`: Selects any element with a property `name` whose value is 1.
* `[name = 1]`: Equivalent to the above.
* `[name() = "hi"]`: Selects any element whose _node name_ is "hi". Equivalent to just `hi`, but more useful when using string operators.
* `[tag() = "hi"]`: Selects any element whose tag is "hi". Equivalent to just `(hi)`, but more useful when using string operators.
* `[val() != 1]`: Selects any element whose first value exists, and is not 1.

The following operators work with any `val()` or `prop()` values.
If the value is not of the same type, the operator will always fail ("1" is
never coerced to 1, and there is no "universal" ordering across all types.):

* `[val() > 1]`: Selects any element whose first value is greater than 1.
* `[val() >= 1]`: Selects any element whose first value is greater than or equal to 1.
* `[val() < 1]`: Selects any element whose first value is less than 1.
* `[val() <= 1]`: Selects any element whose first value is less than or equal to 1.

The following operators work only with string `val()`, `prop()`, `tag()`, or `name()` values.
If the value is not a string, the matcher will always fail:

* `[val() ^= "foo"]`: Selects any element whose first value starts with "foo".
* `[val() $= "foo"]`: Selects any element whose first value ends with "foo".
* `[val() *= "foo"]`: Selects any element whose first value contains "foo".

The following operators work only with `val()` or `prop()` values. If the value
is not one of those, the matcher will always fail:

* `[val() = (foo)]`: Selects any element whose tag is "foo".

## Map Operator

KQL implementations MAY support a "map operator", `=>`, that allows selection
of specific parts of the selected notes, essentially "mapping" over a
selector's result set.

Only a single map operator may be used, and it must be the last element in a
selector string.

The map operator's right hand side is either an [`accessor`](#accessors) on
its own, or a tuple of accessors, denoted by a comma-separated list wrapped in
`()` (for example, `(a, b, c)`).

## Accessors

Accessors access/extract specific parts of a node. They are used with the [map
operator](#map-operator), and have syntactic overlap with some
[matchers](#matchers).

* `name()`: Returns the name of the node itself.
* `val(2)`: Returns the third value in a node.
* `val()`: Equivalent to `val(0)`.
* `prop(foo)`: Returns the value of the property `foo` in the node.
* `foo`: Equivalent to `prop(foo)`.
* `props()`: Returns all properties of the node as an object.
* `values()`: Returns all values of the node as an array.

## Examples

Given this document:

```kdl
package {
    name "foo"
    version "1.0.0"
    dependencies platform="windows" {
        winapi "1.0.0" path="./crates/my-winapi-fork"
    }
    dependencies {
        miette "2.0.0" dev=true
    }
}
```

Then the following queries are valid:

* `package name`
    * -> fetches the `name` node itself
* `top() > package name`
    * -> fetches the `name` node, guaranteeing that `package` is in the document root.
* `dependencies`
    * -> deep-fetches both `dependencies` nodes
* `dependencies[platform]`
    * -> fetches any dependencies nodes with a `platform` prop (just the one, in this case)
* `dependencies[prop(platform)]`
    * -> Identical to the above. Plain identifiers are equivalent to `prop(<identifier>)`.
* `dependencies > []` ->
    * fetches all direct-child nodes of any `dependencies` nodes in the
      document. In this case, it will fetch both `miette` and `winapi` nodes.

If using an API that supports the [map operator](#map-operator), the following
are valid queries:

* `package name => val()`
    * -> `["foo"]`.
* `dependencies[platform] => platform`
    * -> `["windows"]`
* `dependencies > [] => (name(), val(), path)`
    * -> `[("winapi", "1.0.0", "./crates/my-winapi-fork"), ("miette", "2.0.0", None)]`
* `dependencies > [] => (name(), values(), props())`
    * -> `[("winapi", ["1.0.0"], {"platform": "windows"}), ("miette", ["2.0.0"], {"dev": true})]`
